# Augmented Reality : the end of complex design problems?

Last September, before starting my research thesis in virtual reality, I was invited for a hackathon / sprint design by an aircraft manufacturer in order to study the improvement tracks in the user experience of passengers of their private aircraft range. My team and I won this hackathon by proposing a solution that has a real operational reality, while bringing concrete solutions to existing problems. The prototypes developed allowed us to envision the end of complex tool design problems.

## Private planes, individually designed

This manufacturer is one of the French and world leaders. In particular, they design military aircraft, highly renowned for their quality and manoeuvrability. From their expertise, they also produce a range of private aircraft, very often recommended by pilots, who have a significant role in the choice of aircraft for the owner. The interior, in itself... is very French: elegant, simple, not as imposing as an American design. Unlike car manufacturers, private aircraft manufacturers cannot afford the mass production of many trim components. Some elements express craft, others look more tinkered. Because of the need to certify all equipment delivered as standard with aircraft (expensive processes, roughly a million euros), cabin equipment is designed with the standard and the technical and technological constraints rather than with the user experience in mind. But what's the point, after all? In most cases, if the passenger flies without a hostess, it's by choice. In this case, it is unlikely that he will need to face design difficulties, since his flight crew is there for that.

## Improving the user experience means improving the customer experience despite design difficulties

When the buyer of a private plane already has everything, how can the manufacturer differentiate itself reguarding the quality of his flight? While many customers turn to service solutions (Mobility as a Service, rental rather than exclusive ownership of an aircraft), it is necessary for a manufacturer to be able to differentiate itself. To improve the customer experience in flight, it is therefore necessary to eliminate as many friction points as possible... And therefore to ensure that flight personnel are always experts in the equipment specific to the aircraft model, even if they are not always so qualified. The question becomes how to better train the flying assistant personnel to the specific problems of the plane, while the equipment suffers from design problems in conflict with the regulations. Flight staff, in an ideal world, are assigned to a single aircraft: but in the real world, flight attendants are never experts on the model in which they serve. In some cases, they are part of a commercial fleet and operate on different models, different brands... Equipped differently. On tools created almost individually, it can be difficult to find your way! And yes: when you pay 40 million euros for a private plane, and you can't have a coffee because the hostess didn't understand where the water tap was... There's a lot to get upset about.

## Intelligent training

There are no regulations requiring flight personnel to be qualified on the specific equipment of a private aircraft. Our manufacturer's solution? A "Cabin Guide", a user guide of nearly 200 pages that is supposed to list all the needs of a hostess in the entire cabin. I'll let you guess: such a document is not systematically read in depth by the service team before the plane's departure. To better train the crew, it is necessary to offer a solution with satisfactory usability, i.e. a solution that is effective, efficient and satisfying. Effective, therefore the solution must be accessible without special knowledge, efficient, therefore accessible in an acceptable and finally satisfying, therefore the staff must take pleasure in finding the solution. For this, augmented reality seems a perfectly adapted solution.



## Augmented reality: answering crew questions easily

Virtual reality is still in an early stage, augmented reality even more. In addition to simulating a virtual environment in an immersive context, this universe must also be projected onto real objects. But certain technologies allow prototyping and apprehending these problems. One of the great advantages of augmented reality is to be able to project virtual elements into a real universe: instead of reading a plan and locating an element (such as a fire extinguisher, a coffee machine... or bottles of champagne), augmented reality allows the crew to locate an object in three dimensions in a very effective way. Similarly, augmented reality is used in the industry, with the aim of facilitating complex business actions, which require applying a particular procedure, on specific elements. One can quote, for example, the dismantling of a part in an engine, which requires disconnecting certain cables, unscrewing certain parts... And to leave other elements in place. All this is difficult to record in a manual, but by highlighting the right elements (using augmented reality) one can very easily perform these tasks with very little business knowledge. This contextual approach therefore makes it possible to offer a solution easily, effectively, efficiently and satisfyingly.

## Two prototypes for specific use cases

To help locate items in space, my team and I made a prototype location aid application (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMa3mAM6iMk), using ARCore on an Android phone. Open the application, ask where the extinguisher is, and a red arrow appears: the equipment is behind the hatch. A hostess could follow a safety route before the aircraft starts, with either red arrows or ground courses that would allow her to locate the safety elements directly in space using her visual memory. The team would then be even more operational in the event of an accident. Similarly, we assembled a prototype of a procedural approach by describing the process of a coffee machine (https://youtu.be/FAlK-ah2xno), which makes it possible to imagine more complex machines, where it is enough to act on the right actuators, in a precise order. Two concrete examples that make it possible to imagine a quick solution to the essential problems that exist in the cabin.

## The end of user manuals... But also complex design work?

Aeronautical equipment manufacturer is a complex job: each element delivered in an aircraft must obey very strict certifications, and must withstand very particular conditions which push to put in background the user experience. My example of complementarity between complex tools to use because of their design difficulties and emerging solutions such as augmented reality guides could bring the end of the designer's problem, the duty to propose an easy to use solution, since he can become, at any time and especially easily an expert on the product thanks to a quick training. In today's transition from very personnal vehicles to car fleets, available on demand, a serious design problem appears: how can a manufacturer develop innovative, but complex features in a car that a user will have to onboard in a few minutes? Well, augmented reality and similar scenarios might be the answer. It could also pave the way for more ambitious complex features... That would still be simple to handle in a matter of seconds.
